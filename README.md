# Detection Rules

This repository contains detection rules inspired by articles I read. Every weekend, I explore cybersecurity articles and translate key insights into practical detection rules.

## Purpose
- Enhance threat detection capabilities by implementing rules based on real-world security research.
- Continuously improve my detection knowledge through regular learning
- Repo structure is based on [Sigma rule](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules-emerging-threats)
